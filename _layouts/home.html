<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About me</h3>
<ul>
  <br>I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the 
  College of William & Mary, fortunate to be advised by Prof. 
  <a href=" https://sarchlab.org/syifan">Yifan Sun</a>.

  <br>Previously, I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
   from the University of Florida and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from
    Beijing Technology and Business University.

  <br> My research broadly centers on computer architecture. I am particularly
   interested in exploring wafer-scale GPU architecture and developing tools 
   for computer architecture simulation. I am still learning, and always eager
    to deepen my understanding through both research and collaboration.
